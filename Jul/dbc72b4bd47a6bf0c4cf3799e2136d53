Stockbrokers in Nigeria may soon have the flexibility of trading in the United Kingdom and many other countries following the special training being organised by the Chartered Institute of Stockbrokers in collaboration with the Chartered Institute of Securities and Investment in the UK. This was contained in a statement by the CIS on Thursday. By the proposed two-pronged joint training, slated for August 10 to August 18 at the Nigerian Stock Exchange, the participants, according to CIS, will be exposed to: understanding modern  commodity derivative and international introduction to securities and investment market. As part of the strategies to globalise the operations of the stockbrokers and other practitioners in the financial market, the International Introduction to Securities and Investment Market is designed to prepare the participants to take examination for the CISI’s qualification, a major requirement for practising in all countries where CISI UK is recognised. According to the statement, ISSI offers candidates a broader economic environment in which the financial services industry operates and examines how an economic activity is determined and managed in different economic and political systems. The statement added, “The commodity derivative training on its own is a high-impact programme that will equip participants with a comprehensive understanding of commodity  markets, commodity trading, risk management and derivatives in relation to agriculture,  oil and gas, agro-allied company, finance and energy both in international and local  perspectives.”
