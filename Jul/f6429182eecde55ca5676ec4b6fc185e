The Course 25 Nigeria’s National Defence College, NDC, has presented the report of a research work on terrorism to Acting President Yemi Osinbajo, recommending a special court for the trial of offences related to terrorism. The NDC also recommended the involvement of Nigeria’s armed forces in the rebuilding of parts of North East Nigeria ravaged by the activities of the boko haram insurgency. These were among recommendations contained in the report of a research work, which was presented to Professor Osinbajo on Friday at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. The Commandant of the NDC, Rear Admiral Ilesanmi Alade told State House Correspondents after presenting the report that the work was “about contributions to government policy.” “NDC as a strategic institution is in a very good position to contribute in this way,” he said. Rear Admiral Alade said the report dwelt on terrorism and its implications for national development. He said the report also talked about the Nigerian experience in terrorism and how it was being tackled. The NDC was established in 1992 as the highest military institution in Nigeria for the training of selected senior military officers, the Nigerian police and civil servants from strategic ministries, departments and agencies of the Nigerian government for higher responsibilities. The college also trains officers from friendly countries.
