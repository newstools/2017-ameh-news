The Enugu State Governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, on Wednesday dropped three commissioners from his cabinet. The three commissioners relieved of their duties are Dr. Godwin Udeuhele (Information), Mr. Charles Ndukwe (Youth and Sports) and Smart Ogbe (Inter-Governmental Affairs). Two new commissioners were inaugurated at a meeting of the State Executive Council. The new commissioners, Mr. Ogbuagu Anikwe and Mr. Joseph Udedi, took over the ministries of Information, and Youth and Sports, respectively. A statement from the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Mr. Uwakwe Abugu, explained that the “changes came as a first step in the move by Governor Ugwuanyi to reshape his cabinet in order to further enhance effective delivery of good governance to the people of Enugu State.” The statement described the new Information Commissioner, Anikwe, as a veteran journalist and a public communications strategist. Anikwe, according to the statement, was the chairman of the Editorial Board of BusinessDay Newspaper, before he was appointed into the State Executive Council. “Anikwe was also a News Editor at The Guardian and later Editor of the Daily Times of Nigeria. “Having honed his skills in public communications over the years, the new commissioner had also worked as a World Bank consultant for the Federal Inland Revenue Service and a number of state governments. “He was also the spokesman for the Federal Government’s Committee on Power Sector Reforms, working with the Presidential Taskforce on Power and the Federal Ministry of Power. “Hence, he has brought a huge depth of wealth of experience to bear on his new task as the government spokesman,” the statement added.
