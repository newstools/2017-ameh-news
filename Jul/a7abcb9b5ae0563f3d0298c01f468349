 The Peoples Democratic Party has asked women to be ready to pay for nomination forms instead of waiting to be asked to pick them free by political parties. It said this would enhance their participation and also earn them respect in politics. The Chairman, National Caretaker Committee of the party, Ahmed Makarfi, stated this when he received the Minister of Women Affairs and Social Development, Senator Jummai Alhassan, at the PDP headquarters in Abuja on Monday.
