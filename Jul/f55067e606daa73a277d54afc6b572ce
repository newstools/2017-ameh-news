 In its bid to pinpoint the exact location of viable crude oil deposits, the Research and Development Division of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation has entered into collaboration with the United States of America-based Halliburton Corporation in the ongoing search for commercial hydrocarbon in the inland sedimentary basins. The Group General Manager, R&D Division, NNPC, Dr. Bola Afolabi, said in Port Harcourt that the collaboration with Halliburton would help fast-track the inland basin exploration efforts through the use of the innovative Neftex solution designed to provide exactitude in drilling for oil. He said the Halliburton Neftex solution, which would provide a geophysical mapping structure of the country, would complement the ongoing in-house efforts by the NNPC research centre to develop what is known as the ‘Turonian Cenomanian Cretaceous source rock’ for all the basins in Nigeria. In a statement issued by the corporation’s spokesperson, Mr. Ndu Ughamadu, on Tuesday in Abuja, Afolabi noted that the development essentially sought to identify all the prolific basins in Nigeria by locating the cretaceous kitchen, or areas where large crude deposits could be found.
