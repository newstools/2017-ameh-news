 Emergency officials have reached ground zero of the four-storeyed building which collapsed on Massey Street, Lagos Island, recovering eight dead bodies –five males and three females. Some of the deceased were identified as Zainab Balogun, Ademola Taiwo, Olayiwola Sikiru and Lawal Mabolaje. Fifteen victims, who sustained varying degrees of injury, were taken to hospitals for treatment. PUNCH Metro had reported that the distressed structure collapsed around 2.30pm on Tuesday, trapping tenants and those who had come to eat at a canteen in the building. It was said that a telecommunications mast recently mounted on the building’s rooftop contributed to the collapse. Two bodies were initially recovered as of 11pm on Tuesday. Our correspondent gathered on Wednesday that six more bodies were brought out as officials of the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency, the state fire service and the National Emergency Management Agency concluded rescue operation at about 1pm. An emergency official disclosed to our correspondent that preliminary investigation revealed that the building was originally a bungalow built about 40 years ago. “The house was a bungalow built about 40 years ago. After some years, another floor was added and it went on like that until it reached four storeys,” he said. Another official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the son of the landlord disappeared immediately the incident happened.
