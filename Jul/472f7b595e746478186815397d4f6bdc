The Ondo State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party has expelled four members of the Ali Modu Sherif’s faction of the party for allegedly frustrating the reconciliation process going on in the party. Among those expelled was the state chairman of the Sheriff’s faction, Mr. Biyi Poroye. Others, who were sent packing from the party, are Johnson Alabi, Yemi Ajonibode and Ademola Genty. Following the ruling of the Supreme Court, which declared Senator Ahmed Makarfi-led National Caretaker Committee as the authentic leadership of the PDP, the party initiated reconciliation moves to bring peace back into the PDP. In a statement on Sunday by the Director of Media and Publicity of the PDP in Ondo State, Mr. Ayo Fadaka, the party alleged that Poroye and others allegedly failed to appear before a disciplinary committee set up by the party in the state. The statement added, “Biyi Poroye, Johnson Alabi, Yemi Ajonibode and Ademola Genty are hereby expelled from the party forthwith. “They therefore cease to be members of the party and cannot take any action in favour of the party or pursue any action or claims against the party.” The party, in the statement, also suspended all members of the factional Poroye-led executive pending when they appear before state disciplinary committee this week. Poroye, however, said the Makarfi-led PDP was not sincere with the reconciliation and harmonisation of the two groups
