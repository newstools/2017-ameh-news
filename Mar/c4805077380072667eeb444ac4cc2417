 MTN Nigeria has not been doing a lot of advertisement recently; remember how their adverts used to be everywhere then when Saka was hijacked from Etisalat, everywhere you went, you’ll hear: “kirikata kirikata kirikata kirikata,  I don port o, I don port o, I don port to mtn…”; they literally stole all the talk shows in town because people were concerned as to why Etisalat allowed Afeez Oyetoro a.k.a. Saka to join such a river company and stage an advert jingle that almost made everybody think of leaving Etisalat network to join MTN. But these days they have stopped most of their adverts, they also not been doing shows like they used to do All these could be as a result of the heavy fine imposed on them by the Nigeria Communications Commission, NCC, for allegedly violating the regulator’s rules. But, when you check out MTN data bundles and MTN data plan for android, you’ll find that their prices have not really changed even though people taught they would have to increase the prices of their services and reduce the quality. One of the services they offer which people are still enjoying is their internet data service. We want to state categorically that their data services remain among the best, below are the 5 reasons we believe MTN Data is still among the best. In line with all these reasons, we advise you to try MTN data plan if you’ve not already done so.
