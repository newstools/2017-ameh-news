President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday said he had never been this sick. “I couldn’t recall being so sick since I was a young man, including in the military with its ups and downs,” he said at a meeting he had with government officials. The President also said he could not recall the last time he had a blood transfusion. Buhari said with or without him, Nigeria will continue.
