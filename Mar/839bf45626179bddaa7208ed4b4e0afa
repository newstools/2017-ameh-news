The only Senator elected under the platform of the Labour Party (LP) in the 8th National Assembly, Senator Ovie Omo-agege, has officially announced his intention to dump his party. Omo-agege, who is representing the people of Delta Central Senatorial District, defected to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), at the resumed plenary, on Tuesday. The Senator cited leadership tussle currently bedeviling the Labour Party, as reason for his defection. With the defection of Omo-agege, the rank of APC Senators has increased to 66, while the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), is coming behind with 42 Senators. There was, however, no reaction from the Minority Leader, Godswill Akpabio.
