Their equity interest in the fund is shared in accordance of the existing national revenue sharing formula of 52.86 per cent to the federal, 26.72 per cent (states) and 20.60 per cent Local Government Councils. The agency, which commenced operations with a seed funding of $1 billion, has had the funding increased by an addition $250 million from the excess crude oil account.
