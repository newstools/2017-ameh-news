Scores of residents of the Olokonla community in the Eti-Osa Local Government Area of Lagos State yesterday appealed to the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, to intervene in the demolition of their houses. The protesters made the plea when they stormed Tinubu’s residence in Ikoyi, Lagos, on Thursday. They alleged that some men who claimed to be the officials of the Lagos State government allegedly demolished their buildings worth over N15billion. The protesters, led by Barrister Mr. Dotun Hassan, said their houses were demolished without a court order. “We appeal to Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, a kind politician, to intervene and stop this demolition. “We are not illegal occupiers. We have our genuine land documents,” he said. Tunde Rahman, Media Assistant to Tinubu, urged the protesters to maintain the peace. He promised to convey their petition to Tinubu and advised their leader to come to the Freedom House next Tuesday. Meanwhile, Ekiti State chapter of Afenifere, pan-Yoruba socio-cultural and political organization, has hailed peace moves made to reconcile some leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the southwest. A statement by Chairman, Elder Yemi Alade and Publicity Secretary, Chief Biodun Akin-Fasae, described the recent Ibadan meeting as “very timely and capable of dousing the tension in the party following the Ondo State governorship primary election.”
