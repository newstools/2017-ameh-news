At least, three of the suspected cultists terrorizing some parts of Ogba-Egbema-Ndoni Local Government Area of Rivers State have been killed. A team of the joint Task Force engaged the hoodlums in a shoot-out which lasted for hours last night, killing three while some escaped with bullet wounds. The operation was in response to the killings that have characterized the area in the past two days. Over ten people were reportedly killed within two days in the area including a House of Representatives Candidate, Azubuike Toby. Unknown gunmen had invaded Ogbo-Ohia area of Omoku town and killed four persons and abducted one. A Similar incident was also recorded in Okposi area where four people were reportedly killed. However, a senior officer attached to the JTF who confirmed the incident said they ambushed the armed hoodlums while they were on their way to carry out another deadly operation within Omoku town. The Rivers State police Command is yet to issue a statement on the latest incidents in ONELGA.
