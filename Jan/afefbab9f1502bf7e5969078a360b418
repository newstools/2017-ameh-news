A Niger Delta activist, Sheriff Mulade has urged Niger Delta Avengers not to resume hostilities. He said peaceful negotiation remained the best option for the region. Mulade urged the group to allow the current prevailing peace in the oil rich region to continue. Speaking in Warri, Delta State on Sunday, the activist, however, called on the Federal Government to do the “needful” by developing the region. Mulade also noted that people of the region were tired of begging the government to develop the source of the nation’s wealth. He said, “I want to state it here that we cannot allow the Niger Delta region to be a theatre of war. All militant groups in the region should give peace a chance. “The people of the region are tired of begging the Federal Government to develop the region producing the wealth of the nation. “The needful should be done by this administration for the suffering people of the region. Government must do everything humanly possible to avert unnecessary crisis that will further ruin our economy.” This is coming at a time the militant group had called on its fighters to prepare for war.
