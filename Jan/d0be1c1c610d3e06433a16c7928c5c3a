The Senator representing Ogun East Senatorial District, Kashamu Buruji, has declared that some people will die before he is extradited to the United States of America, USA, for an ongoing drug trial. Speaking over the weekend, the lawmaker described the move to extradite him to the US as illegal, stressing that the President Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal Government would not oblige the request by the US Government for his extradition. He said he will engage the OPC to confront whoever comes for his extradition. Kashamu said, “There is no extradition that can be brought against me again. The only thing they can do is to watch and catch me on the road; take me to the airport or Cotonou or throw me inside a vessel and take me through the Atlantic Ocean. But I am not going to let that happen. “I don’t go to the beach, and now, I will go and hire OPC, may be like 40. I will load them (in my vehicle), because the day we meet, one has to kill one. That is for sure! One has to kill one because I am not ready to go anywhere. Before that happens, maybe about three, four or five people will die. “But I do not believe that this government can entertain this kind of rubbish. I do believe that this government has integrity and they (officials) are credible; they believe in the rule of law, because if they want to do it, they could have done it. “Obasanjo has been pushing them, using one Sandra, a former ambassador of the United States; he’s the one pushing everybody, meeting all these judges, but what have I done?” Similarly, the Ogun-born lawmaker has said that the allegations of drug trafficking against him, was a case of mistaken identity, stressing that there is no extradition case against me anywhere in the world.
