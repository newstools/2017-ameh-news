Biafra National Guard, BNG, has issued a one-month ultimatum to the Federal Government to release leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu and other pro – Biafra agitators in detention. BNG warned that failure to release Kanu and others will result in an offensive attack against the government. This was contained in a statement signed by the group’s Public Relations Officer, Ruben Okoro. BNG also announced the launched of “Operation Python Cry” as a parody of the Operation Python Dance launched by the Nigerian Army last year. .
The statement reads: “Let’s forget our leadership tussles; rather, let’s go like our fathers by casting lots and inquiring to find out from our gods who our fearless David is who holds our Offor Biafra, that is Biafra’s symbol of authority. “This will help us confront and wage this war against our today’s Goliath and Pharaoh. “Our Biafran fathers fought only a war of self-defence from 1967-1970, but we Biafran youths will fight both offensive and defensive war to make the entire Biafraland safe. “We now launch Operation Python Cry and hereby urge the Federal Government to release Kanu, Orji, Onwuka and other Biafra freedom fighters in jail. “This must be done as quickly as possible on or before January ending, or else, all the pythons that are now dancing, will turn around and cry. “To guard, defend and protect Biafraland and its territorial integrity is a task that must be done.”
