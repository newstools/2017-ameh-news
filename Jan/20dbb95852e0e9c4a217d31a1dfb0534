Sterling Bank Plc has hinged its foray into the health sector on the current poor state of the sector in the country and the consequences of this on the citizens coupled with the need for public- private collaboration for adequate repositioning.

He further emphasised the bank’s interest in a cleaner healthier environment for Nigerians “as demonstrated in our Sterling Make-Over (STEM) initiative which continues to reinforce our conviction in a cleaner and more prosperous nation”. The bank expressed optimism that the ‘Challenge’ would contribute to helping Nigeria make progress in the areas of vaccination coverage among young children; check contraceptive prevalence rate among Nigerians; increase Vitamin A coverage among children of between six months to five years of age and promote the use of insecticide-treated bed nets by children under five amongst others.
