A harmonized vigilante group in Osun, on Wednesday cautioned residents of the state over what it called the aftermath of the fall of camp Zairo in the Sambisa forest, saying dislodgement of the insurgents could result to infiltration of many communities in Nigeria. The head of the organisation, Alhaji Rilwan Hussein, gave the charge in Ede, while speaking with DAILY POST on the recent fall of the Sambisa forest and the attendant attacks on some soft targets around the country. Hussein said intelligence reports indicate that some States in the South West geo-political zone could be infiltrated by fleeing Boko Haram members, who might be seeing the zone as a safe haven, warning residents to be more vigilant than ever. According to him, all hands must be on deck to prevent any attack on soft target in the region, in which strange movements and unusual activities must be reported promptly to the police as a way of averting any catastrophe. Hussein averred that the safety of citizenry and property of any community solely depended on the level of security consciousness of all and sundry, charging residents of the state to support security agencies to nip any act of criminality in the bud. He,however, urged the country’s security chiefs to brace up and go back to the drawing board for robust National Security strategies against insurgency. “In as much as we all appreciate and commend the much awaited fall of Sambisa forest, the hitherto save haven of Boko Haram, we are so much concerned about the possible implication of the dislodgement of the sect, which might prompt their desperate incursion in our communities. ” Our state has been so lucky to have had committed and patriotic security agencies, with the massive support and collaboration of the residents, and vigilance of my members around the state. “We must not be caught unaware of any thing, all hands must be on deck to monitor any unwholesome activity and unusual movement,” Hussein said.
