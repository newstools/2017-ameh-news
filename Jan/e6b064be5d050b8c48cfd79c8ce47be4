Nigerian government has condemned the killing of another Nigerian, Tochukwu Nnadi, in South Africa. Senior Special Assistant to the President on Foreign Affairs and Diaspora, Abike Dabiri-Erewa, in a statement, described the latest extra-judicial killing as “worrying and condemnable”. Dabiri-Erewa said the gruesome killing of Nnadi by Police in South Africa, was unacceptable to the people and government of Nigeria. The statement signed by her media assistant, Abdur-Rahman Balogun, however, reiterated President Muhammadu Buhari’s call to Nigerians to avoid crimes like drug peddling, which attracts stiff penalties. Dabiri-Erewa lamented that the killing of Nnadi had brought to 20 the number of Nigerians killed in South Africa in 2016 alone. Ikejiaku Chinedu, Monday Okorie, Gideon Ogalaonye, Nnamdi Michael, Adeniyi Olumoko, Christian Onwukaike were also victims.. The presidential aide stated that, “The barbaric behaviour of the perpetrators is not only unacceptable, but also calls for urgent attention by diplomatic authorities in Nigeria and South Africa.” “My heart goes out to the families of the deceased and pray God to grant the departed soul eternal rest.” Dabiri-Erewa charged the South African government to ensure that justice prevails by carrying out investigation and bring the culprit to book. Eyewitnesses say the deceased was not struggling after he was arrested and handcuffed, but one of the officers held onto his neck and squeezed him tightly until blood started gushing out. Meanwhile, the Nigeria Union in Pretoria has also condemned the killing. Its secretary, Mr. Adetola Olubajo, called on the Nigerian Mission “to demand results of investigations of all murder cases involving Nigerian victims from the South African authority’’. Although a high number of Nigerians have been victims of the xenophobia in South Africa, the country’s government has not carried out major prosecution of those behind the killings.
