The lawmaker representing Bayelsa East Senatorial District, Senator Ben Murray Bruce, has advised President Muhammadu Buhari on the steps to take to end recession in 2017. Murray-Bruce said for Nigeria to get out of the current economic recession and overcome its challenges, the present administration must stop the blame game on the past administration. In a series of tweets posted @benmurraybruce, he said, “In 2016, we placed too much emphasis on blaming and particularly on blaming the immediate past admin of former President @GEJonathan. “The blame knew no bounds with some people alleging that Jonathan did not achieve anything by way of infrastructure, a pitiable lie! “In 2017, we should stop this habit of blaming past admins and solve the economic challenges that have made Nigeria slip into recession. “The genocide in S. Kaduna must stop in 2017 and in the Niger Delta, we must explore genuine dialogue if we want our oil production to grow.”
