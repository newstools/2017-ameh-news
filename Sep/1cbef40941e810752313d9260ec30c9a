The Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria Centre for Financial Studies (CIBNCFS), a subsidiary of The Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN), has concluded arrangements to organize a Breakfast Session on Collateral Registry Act: Pros and Cons for the Nigerian Banking Industry and Other Stakeholders. In a view to addressing the financing gap in Nigeria’s Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) Sector, the National Assembly and the House of Representatives passed into law the Secured Transactions in Movable Assets Act, 2017 (otherwise known as the Collateral Registry Act) in May, 2017. The Act is designed to afford MSMEs the opportunity of acquiring loans using movable assets as collateral from financial institutions. While this is indeed a welcome development, apprehensions among stakeholders are rife regarding the implications of this Act on the current high level of Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) in the industry amongst all other risks financial institutions are exposed to in the country.  The Session, which would feature subject-matter experts as discussants, would among other things discuss international best practices in leveraging Collateral Registry Act for facilitating access to credit by the MSMEs sector, modalities for achieving a win-win relationship between financial institutions and the MSMEs for improved growth and development and the roles of all stakeholders – government, regulatory institutions, financial services operators, MSMEs etc – in this value chain. The programme is expected to have in attendance representatives from the National Assembly, regulatory institutions (CBN, NDIC etc), Chief Risk Officers, Credit Risk Managers, Bank SME Business Managers, Chief Strategy Officers, Chief Operating Officers, Microfinance Banks, Government Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) and the Nigerian Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (NASME).
