The Chairman, Oshodi/Isolo Local Government Area, Mr. Bolaji Muse-Ariyo, has said a substation belonging to Ikeja Electric was shut because the company failed to pay the annual rent due to the government. Our correspondent gathered that the substation was reopened on Monday one week after it was shut down, with residents of the community thrown into blackout. “They are not paying us our rent; they are not giving us adequate light and they are giving us estimated bills and no prepaid meters. They are meant to pay it (rent) every year; they have not paid the rent,” Muse-Ariyo told our correspondent . He noted that he had to check his books when asked the amount of rent owed by the company. Asked why the substation was reopened, he said, “Because there was an intervention. Before we shut it down, we called them for a meeting and they disregarded the invitation from the government. So, if any person or any organisation is bigger than the government, the least we can do is to shut the facility, which was what we did.” He said the company was given a 21-day warning prior to the shutdown of the facility. The Head, Corporate, Communications, Ikeja Electric, Mr. Felix Ofulue, who confirmed that the substation had been reopened, said, “I am not aware that the company is financially committed to Oshodi/Isolo Local Government or the chairman in any way. We have over 70 of those substations in Lagos under our network.”
