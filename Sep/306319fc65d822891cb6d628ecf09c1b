 The Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Dr. Maikanti Baru, has said that an average of 700,000bpd of crude oil was deferred in 2016 due to pipeline sabotage, saying this brought Nigeriaâ€™s production down to as low as 1.3 million barrels per day from 2.2 million barrels targeted for the period.
