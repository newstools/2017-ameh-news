The forum, which had the theme “Galvanising SMEs for inclusive development” was chaired by Prof. Pat Utomi. Elumelu, who was represented by the President/Chief Executive Officer, Transcorp Group, Mr. Adim Jibunoh, noted that SMEs were powerful tools for job creation especially for those at the bottom of the pyramid. He said, “The only way to reduce dependence on oil or the new area we are looking at, agriculture, is to build up an industries and diversify the economy. The process of that industrialisation can however not begin without the mobilisation of the SMEs to attain that goal.” The Founder, LAPO, Mr. Godwin Ehigiamusoe, said the SMEs remained the backbone of economic development and industrialisation, saying the sector was the take-off stage of the advanced economies of the world.
