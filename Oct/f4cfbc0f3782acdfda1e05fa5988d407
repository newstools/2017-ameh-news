The Standards Organization of Nigeria (SON) has raised alarm over the influx of fake made in Nigeria electricity cables cloned abroad into the country.  Speaking yesterday one day sensitisation program it organised for shippers and freight agents in Lagos, the Director-General of the organisation, Dr Osita Aboloma disclosed that the locally made cables were the best in the world, even as he warned Nigerians to properly scrutinize what they buy.  The DG who was represented by the Director, Compliance and Monitoring, Engineer  Bede Obayi said importing products and labeling it made in Nigeria won’t discourage the federal government  campaign on patronising made in Nigeria products.  The DG lamented that cable manufacturers travel abroad to clone their products and ship them  to Nigeria markets as made in Nigeria goods, adding that such products have not been tested and validated for use.  The DG said SON is proud of made In Nigeria cables and would want it to be exported.  He said, “Today, due to the effort of SON and Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), especially in the area of cable manufacturing, we have identified that made in Nigeria cables are the best in the world and because of that, people are cloning ‎them abroad.  “Made in Nigeria cables has NIS certification and you see people cloning their brands and bringing it back into the country as if they are made in Nigeria and already certified by SON, it is not true because imported goods cannot be branded as  made in Nigeria.  We are proud of cables manufactured in Nigeria and we want to sell and export them as made in Nigeria”  He said that the cloned ones have not been tested, they have not been validated in terms of their quality and that is why SON will not allow non compliance in Nigeria and anyone who want to import must do that in line with our conformity assessment programme.  Recall that the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS),  recently intercepted two containers loads of imported cables labeled as made in Nigeria and already cleared from the seaport.
