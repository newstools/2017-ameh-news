The Owa Tapa of Ijesha, Osun State, Dr. Olapade Agoro, has dragged the Osun State Commissioner of Police, Mr. Fimihan Adeoye, before the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, over the alleged embarrassment caused him by the police. Agoro, who is also the patriarch of Aladura Church, claimed that the CP, in a press interview he granted in September, maligned his person, good reputation and business interests. The commissioner of police had been quoted in a newspaper report to have accused Agoro of concocting lies against the Osun State Police Command so as to escape being taken to court for some alleged criminal and traffic offences. According to the report, Agoro had earlier accused some policemen from the Osun State Police Command of handcuffing a bus passenger to a police patrol van in Itapa and extorting money from him following the escape of the driver of the bus from a police checkpoint. In his suit, Agoro said the CP maligned him and, therefore, urged the court to award N1m in damages in his favour against the police boss. Agoro, who sued the Osun State CP, Adeoye, along with the Inspector-General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, urged the court to restrain the police from “further harassing, embarrassing and extorting bribe from him.” He is also urging the court to make an order compelling the defendants to publish an apology to the plaintiff and which words of apology must first be seen and approved by the honourable court before publication on the front pages of three national newspapers – The PUNCH, Daily Trust and The Guardian.” In his statement of claim, Agoro claimed that rather than commending him for calling for the probe of “the criminals in police uniform” who allegedly handcuffed a passenger to their Hilux van, the CP “woefully derailed by telling unfounded lies against my good name and global respect in Nigeria and the whole world in the story  published as, “Handcuffed passenger: Police accuse monarch of mischief.”
