Dr. Osita Aboloma,  Director General of Standards Organisation of Nigeria, SON, has blamed faking and adulteration of products in the country on improper monitoring by manufacturers. According to the report, Aboloma stated this during the presentation of Mandatory Conformity Assessment Programme (MANCAP) certificate to Polar Petrochemicals Limited, Ilorin, Kwara.  He said: “I call on the management of the company and indeed manufacturers across Nigeria to deliberately synergise with the distributors as experience has shown  that adulteration, faking or any manner of tampering with the products  is usually traced to improper monitoring and communication gap.  ” The SON boss who was represented by group head, chemical technologies, SON, Agboola  Afolayan, urged Nigerians to patronise ‘made in Nigeria’ products, noting that they can compete with similar products manufactured  elsewhere in the world. “By this certification, the company’s name and products are already in  the SON website and can be accessed all over the world. The certification has also licensed the company to market its products beyond the shores of this country,” he said. In his remark, Chairman of the company, Alhaji Tasiu Mustapha, assured  that the standard with which the company started operation  shall be sustained to all the stakeholders’ satisfaction
