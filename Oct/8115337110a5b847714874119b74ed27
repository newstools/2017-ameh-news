To demonstrate the resilience of the telecommunication sector even in the face of challenging economic climate, Danbatta stayed that the sector contributed about 9.5% to Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Product in the second quarter of 2017 and credited the Nigerian telecom consumers with the successes recorded because of their patronage. The rise in the tempo and  quantity of demonstrations of faith and interest in the Nigerian telecommunication industry received further boost this afternoon when a delegation from the United States Embassy in Abuja visited the Head Office of the Nigerian Communications Commission to gain insight into the workings of the Commission and to commend NCC’s Management for its regulatory strides in  sustaining the growth of the telecommunication industry in Nigeria.

The team, led by Rachel Atwood Mendiola, Fraud Prevention Manager at the Embassy, was received at the Commission with characteristic warmth by NCC’s Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive, Prof. Umar Danbatta and other top Management staff of the Commission.

Danbatta recalled to the admiration of his guests some of the  Commission’s efforts in ensuring effective regulation of the  telecoms sector and providing an enabling environment for telecoms services to flourish exponentially attributing Commission’s successes to the faith reposed in it by the consumers and their unflinching loyalty. The reason the Commission commits itself irrevocably to protecting the interest of consumers and all stakeholders in the industry.

As a world-class organisation, Danbatta told his guests that NCC continues to be a strategic member and active participant in the activities of many bodies including the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), African Telecommunications Union (ATU), and the West Africa Telecommunication Regulators Assembly (WATRA).


The EVC/CEO of NCC said it is the faith the consumers have demonstrated in the sector that made the Management of the Commission to declare the 2017 as the Year of the Telecom Consumer to celebrate the primacy of the consumer and to rededicate itself to addressing the challenges of the consumer.
