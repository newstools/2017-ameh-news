MTN Nigeria has said it will approach a higher court for justice to be served in the case between it and a former employee, Paul Odunewu. The National Industrial Court of Nigeria, Akure, in a judgement by Justice Oyejoju Oyewunmi, had ordered MTN Nigeria Communications Limited and MTN International, Mauritius to pay the former Network Group Operations Manager, Odunewu, a sum of N4,825,036,735.9 as compensation for wrongful termination of employment. In a statement on Monday, the General Manager, Corporate Affairs, MTN Nigeria, Omasan Ogisi, said following the review by the company’s legal partners, it had approached a higher court requesting that the decision of the industrial court be set aside. Ogisi stated that the telecoms company noticed that there were critical elements of the case, which were not fully considered by the lower court before taking its position. “We can confirm that the National Industrial Court took a position, which we consider detrimental to our interests in a suit filed by a former employee. The court’s position has been reviewed by our internal and external counsels,” Ogisi said. She added that the company was confident that the outcome at the superior court would be different and that justice would not only be done, but would be seen to be done in the case. Ogisi maintained that MTN treated all its employees fairly, as captured in the details of its employment contracts. According to her, the situation is no different as the most basic commitment MTN made to customers, shareholders, and workers is to conduct itself in an ethical, honest and respectful manner.
