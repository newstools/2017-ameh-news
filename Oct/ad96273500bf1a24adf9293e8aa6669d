 Fidelity Bank Plc is collaborating with Nigerian Conservation Foundation (NCF) and Lagos State Government (LASG) to promote environmental conservation and sustainable development in Nigeria.  Speaking at the 2017 edition of the annual Walk for Nature (WFN) event held in Marina, Lagos at the weekend, the Bank’s Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Nnamdi Okonkwo emphasised the need for increased collaboration particularly amongst private sector entities with the principal objective to safeguard the environment for future generations.  Okonkwo who was represented by the Bank’s Head, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) & Sustainability, Chris Nnakwe stated, “As a Bank, we understand that there is a need to protect the environment in order to secure a healthy and prosperous future for our customers”, he stated.

Speaking about the rationale behind the partnership with NCF, Nnakwe said the Bank is committed to sustainable practices that not only help to improve the quality of life of the populace but guarantees the preservation of the environment and the social and cultural values of the communities.  Commissioner for Environment Lagos state, Samuel Babatunde Adejare, urged participants to imbibe and cultivate good environmental practices for nature conservation and sustainable environmental management.  The 5 kilometre walk, which was a brazen display of undiluted passion and love for the environment, brought together individuals from all works of life, with the primary objective of building and sustaining a more lasting union to safeguard the environment. The “Walk for Nature” is an annual programme of the NCF designed to create awareness among the people about Nature Conservation and Good Environmental Practices in Nigeria.
