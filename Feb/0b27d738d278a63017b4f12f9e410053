The Senator representing Imo North senatorial district, Benjamin Uwajumogu, has commended the Nigerian Judiciary, for its tacit support and sterling contributions towards deepening the country’s fledgling democracy. Senator Uwajumogu, who was reacting to the judgment delivered by the Imo North Election Petition Tribunal, which upheld his election, maintained that, the country’s judiciary has continued to play its role as the last hope of the common man. He described the Tribunal’s judgment as, “total reaffirmation” of the mandate given to him by the people of Okigwe zone during the last concluded Imo north senatorial re-run election. The former Imo Assembly Speaker, however, called on his major challenger and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate in the election, Chief Athan Achonu, to come on board and join him in the onerous task of developing Okigwe zone. He opined that, having remained behind its contemporaries in the area of sustainable development in the state, there must be concerted effort by the brothers in the district to chart a positive course for the people. “My feeling about all this tussle as a party and as a son of Okigwe zone is that, we should brace up to the challenges of true reconciliation and peace, so that we can facilitate the dividends of democracy for our people”, Uwajumogu said. The Senator also thanked the people of the area, for their continued overwhelming support and prayers to him throughout the legal tussle and pledged his total commitment to superlative legislative performance.
