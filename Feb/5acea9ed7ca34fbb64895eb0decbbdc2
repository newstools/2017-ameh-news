Acting President, Yemi Osinbajo has nicknamed Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, ‘Mr. Project.’ Osinbajo made the appellation on Wike in the Government House, Port Harcourt, after inspecting the various projects executed by the governor. Recall that Osinbajo on Monday commenced a working visit to the Niger Delta region. His visit was part of Federal Government’s measure to interact with leaders of the oil rich region which is aimed at finding a lasting solution to the crisis in the area. During the state dinner organized in his honour by the state government, Osinbajo said he was impressed by the various project sites he visited. He said, “I think he deserves the title of ‘Mr. Projects’; he is indeed ‘Mr. Projects’. “As we came in today, we had to visit some project sites. “The visit to the state was critical because of the position of the state in the country. “Rivers State is very important to us. We take matters concerning the state seriously. We will cooperate with Rivers State to develop Nigeria. “It is in the interest of our people and the nation that we work together for the good of our people. “We need to get together to chart the pathway of growth,” the Acting President noted. In his response, Governor Wike reassured that the state government will cooperate with the federal government to deliver development to the people. He said, “I believe that the visit of the Acting President will bring good relationship between the federal government and Rivers State. “Let us allow the interest of the majority in whatever we do. Party must take the back seat. The interest of Rivers State is paramount. “That is why we are doing everything we can to cooperate with the federal government because we believe in the unity of this nation.”
