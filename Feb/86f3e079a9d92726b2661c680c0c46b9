President Muhammdu Buhari is not in Abuja House, London, an official told a Guardian reporter on Sunday. The unidentified official made the disclosure when the reporter attempted to see the President who is currently on medical vacation. Recounting his encounter, the reporter quoted a staff member of the Abuja House, as saying, “As far as I’m concerned, he’s not here.” The Abuja House is the official residence of the Nigerian High commissioner to the United Kingdom, UK. He wrote: “At 2:50 p.m., when a black Mercedes jeep arrived, the occupant sitting by the driver rolled down the glass and asked, “Why are you here? “When I told him that l was a reporter with The Guardian and l had come to see if the president was there and to interview him, he looked quite irritated and replied angrily: ‘he’s not here, you can’t see anybody here.’ “In an extraordinary move, two police officers, Constables Marlett and Stock, were called in by the security staff at the Abuja House to arrest the reporter. “When both arrived on their motorcycles, they took the reporter’s name and date of birth and subsequently made a check on the national database, before staying around for about 20 minutes and then left. “Prior to that, the security staff threatened the reporter with the police when he called at the Kensington residence to interview President Buhari about his continued stay in the UK.” Recall that shortly after Buhari embarked on his vacation few weeks ago, rumour had it that he was dead. This was further fuelled by the fact that the President who was expected back in the country, following the completion of his vacation, sent a letter to the National Assembly same day  extending his 10-day vacation in the UK  to enable him complete and receive medical results.
