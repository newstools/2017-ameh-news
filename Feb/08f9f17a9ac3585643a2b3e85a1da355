This is coming at the heels of protests embarked upon by some Nigerians across the nation, kicking against some of the policies of the Buhari-led Federal Government. Earlier in the week, some anti-government protesters led by co-convener of the BringBackOurGirls, BBOG, and former Chairman of the Human Rights Commission, HRC, Chidi Odinkalu staged a protest march to the entrance of the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Security agents, however, prevented the anti-Buhari protesters from gain access into the premises of the Villa. The group which chanted anti-government songs, lamented that “there is hardship in the land”. Addressing the protesters at the entrance of the Villa, Odinkalu stated that the All Progressives Congress, APC-led Federal Government has failed. “Our leaders have failed us. We are asking the government to fix energy, fight corruption. Those are our demands,” Odinkalu said.
