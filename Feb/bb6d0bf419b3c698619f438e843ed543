A Presidential Task Force has been constituted to urgently consider measures that will ensure a steady flow of produce to the market and reverse recent price increases. Acting President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo gave the directive at Wednesday’s Federal Executive Council meeting in Abuja. Availability of food items
Professor Osinbajo expressed concern at the inflationary rates of food prices, saying “the Task Force will explore options to promote availability and affordability of food items to Nigerians.’’ The Task Force will also consider how to remove some of the cost-raising factors that come into play between the farms and the markets, bringing relief to the people. “While there have been reports of bumper harvests in parts of the country, the prices of food stuff are still high, some of the produce even end up wasted due to a number of reasons preventing effective transportation delivery to the markets,’’ the acting President stated. Reviewing transportation
Professor Osinbajo said one of the focus areas of the Task Force would be to review the transportation and preservation processes and to see how government could intervene in those aspects to bring down food prices. Members of the Task Force are; Minister of Agriculture & Rural Development, Audu Ogbeh, Minister of Finance, Mrs Kemi Adeosun, Minister of Industry, Trade & Development, Dr. Okey Enelamah, Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, Minister for Water Resources, Suleiman Adamu and Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige. The Offices of the Chief of Staff to the President and the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Sustainable Development Goals, SDGs, would also be on the Task Force. They have seven days to draw out a practical plan and present same to the Council next week.
