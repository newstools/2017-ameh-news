The Chief Imam of Area 10 Mosque in the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, Abuja, Sheikh Yahya Al-Yolawi has said it is a sin before Allah for men to deny their wives sexual satisfaction. He advised husbands to ensure satisfaction of their wives sexual needs in order to prevent immorality. While delivering his Jumma’at Sermon titled: ‘The Duties and Responsibilities of Husband and wife in Islam’ on Friday, the Muslim cleric said there were certain men, who after marriage do not satisfy the sexual needs of their wives. The Imam said, “Such people are great sinners and will be convicted in the sight of Allah. “Husbands have a duty to satisfy their wives’ minimum sexual requirements so that they may not commit a sin by eyeing other men in order to quench their thirst. “Allah, the most high, has granted women the right to conjugal relations with their husbands. “Husbands must value their wives and never appreciate the beauty of other woman in the present of their wives. “This may lead to jealousy and suspicion in the mind of the wife. She would think that her husband has some feelings or relationship with that woman. “This thought is a poison that kills matrimonial relations and should be avoided. “Couples must be patient and compassionate in their dealings; husbands must always express their full confidence and trust in their wives. “To prove this, husbands should hand over the house keep to their wives so that they may feel dignified and involved. “Prophet Muhammad said that the woman is the guardian and caretaker of her husband’s house and Almighty Allah will require an account from her in this regard on the Day of Judgment. “This will give the husband an opportunity to freely think of other things regarding the promotion, growth development and progress of his career or business,” Al-Yolawi added
