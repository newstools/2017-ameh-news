South Sudan has once again rejected the suggestion that the country be placed under UN trusteeship. The government said that the international community should support implementation of the African Union-brokered peace deal rather than impose a trusteeship regime. Ateny Wek Ateny, South Sudanese Presidential spokesman said, “It is our right. It is our country. We fought for it. We achieved the independence through referendum. The people of South Sudan decided for their country. So nobody is better than the people of South Sudan.” If South Sudan is placed under the UN trusteeship then the body will govern the country for a specific period of time before handing governance back to South Sudanese. Some former government officials have proposed putting the country under UN trusteeship. “There are always minority voices that would hope for something totally different from what the majority of people of any given country say,” explained Ateny. On Thursday Uganda rejected the notion, saying such interference would only make the country’s security situation worse. South Sudan broke into conflict in December 2013. The conflict has killed thousands of people and driven more than 2 million from their homes. Currently, more than 200,000 people still sheltered under UN protection in many parts of the war torn nation. In 2014, President Salva Kiir accused the UN of seeking to take over the country and speculated that UNMISS may have pushed his political rival, former vice president Riek Machar, to rise up against the government. *Reported by africanews.com
