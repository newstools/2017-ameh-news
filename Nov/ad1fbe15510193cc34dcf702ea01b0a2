The Lagos State Governor, Akinwunmi Ambode, on Wednesday inaugurated a new road linking the premises of the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital from Mobolaji Bank Anthony Way in Ikeja. Ambode, who also inspected the progress of work on the LASUTH Maternity Hospital, popularly known as Ayinke House, instructed contractors handling the project to deliver in six months. Ambode expressed delight at the completion of the road, saying it would ensure faster access to medical care. He said, “We realised that just one entrance into LASUTH is too dangerous. It has been like that for almost three or four decades; but we are happy to open another access road to boost the process of saving lives. “Patients can come in ambulance, but they can be held up in traffic for almost 30 minutes and unable to disembark. However, this road will remove the tragedy that may occur through such delay. In another five to six months, we will be back here to make the Ayinke House functional.” Ambode, who also inspected ongoing projects across the state, ordered additional projects such as a lounge and canteen for families of patients as well as Ear, Nose and Throat Department in the ongoing upgrade and expansion of the Alimosho General Hospital. The Chief Medical Director of LASUTH, Prof. Adewale Oke, commended Ambode for his commitment to the health sector. The Provost of the Lagos State University College of Medicine, Prof. Babatunde Sholagbero, also thanked the governor for facilitating the accreditation of Dentistry Department of the institution, saying such had made LASU the only state university in Nigeria that offered bachelor of dentistry degree.
