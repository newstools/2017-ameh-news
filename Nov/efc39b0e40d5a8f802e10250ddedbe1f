A group, Transparency and Accountability Network in Nasarawa State, has raised the alarm over what it describes as the flouting of Section 190 of the 1999 Constitution by Governor Umaru Al-Makura for allegedly travelling out of the country without notifying the state’s House of Assembly. Coordinator of the group, Mr. Shettima Shitu, on Friday, said that the governor left the country last Saturday for an undisclosed country without handing over to his deputy, Mr. Silas Agara. Shitu said the offence violated Section 190 of the constitution. According to him, Al-Makura travelled out of the country at a time when there was fragile peace in the state and lives were threatened due to the influx of Fulani herdsmen into Nasarawa from Benue State. He said, “The governor has the right to travel out of the country to attend to his health or on casual leave or to woo investors, but doing so without adhering to constitutional provisions, is wrong. When contacted by Saturday PUNCH, Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Mr. Musa Elayo, said, “Governor Al-Makura has respect for the constitution; there is no leadership vacuum in the state, the deputy governor is in charge of the state and he is in constant touch with the governor. “So, he has not broken any law because he has not indicated an intention to stay for more than three weeks.” Also, Chief Press Secretary to the Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Mr. Jibrin Gona, said that he was not aware of any letter before his principal empowering the deputy governor to act on behalf of the governor following his absence from the state.
