Zimbabwe’s former vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa will on Wednesday return home more than two weeks after fleeing the country following his ouster by ex-president Robert Mugabe, his aide said. “Comrade Mnangagwa is coming back today,” one of his personal assistants, Larry Mavhima, told AFP, adding that he was expected to brief the media after his arrival.
