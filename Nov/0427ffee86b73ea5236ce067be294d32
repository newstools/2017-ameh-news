There was confusion and despair yesterday afternoon, as heavily armed policemen stormed the Lagos International Trade Fair Complex Ojo and sealed the offices of Aulic Nigeria Ltd. The police team, led by a Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), upon arrival at a section of the complex housing the concessionaire, ordered workers out of their offices before sealing the place. The Federal Government, a few weeks ago revoked the concession of the Lagos State Trade Fair Complex, in breach of the agreement. Speaking to Daily Sun on the matter, Barrister Dan Udeh, company secretary, Aulic Nigeria Ltd, described the action as “impunity and a great affront to the rule of law.” According to him, “it is a shame that the police, who are supposed to be the protector of the law, would so brazenly allow themselves to be used by certain individuals who claim to be above the law, to subvert the order of the court.” He said the matter was in court, with a pending order that all parties in the disagreement should maintain the status quo.

He said the police claimed their action was based on an “order from above,” the lawyer noted that it was wrong for “the government and the police to resort to self help over a matter a court of competent jurisdiction had already ordered all parties to maintain status quo.” He called for the rule of the law to be respected. When contacted, the PRO Lagos State police command, ASP Olarinde Famous-Cole, said he would make enquiries about the matter. For some years now, the concessionaire had been locked in a legal battle with the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) and LITFC management board over the concession of the Lagos International Trade Fair Complex.
