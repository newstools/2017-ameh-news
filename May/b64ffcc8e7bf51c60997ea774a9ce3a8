The Nigerian Minister of Health, Prof. Isaac Adewole, has called on Nigerians not to panic, as the Federal Government remains committed to ensuring that the Ebola virus is not brought into the country. The Minister states this on Monday, while inspecting thermal screening machines at the Port Health Stand of the Nnamdi Azikwe International Airport, Abuja. The Minister was at the Airport on assessment tour to ensure that the screening machines were functioning perfectly, as the country steps up surveillance in detecting fevers of any kind. Adewole said: “We want to assure Nigerians that we have never stopped screening people. It has been going on at the International wing of all the airports in the country, although passengers may not have noticed it. There is no reason to panic, everything is under control, if there is a need to screen local passengers we would do that, but for now we are concentrating on passengers on international  travels.” He said that people should be free to go about their lawful business, but report any signs or symptoms of fever to the nearest health facility. Earlier, the Minister had a meeting with the Airport Manager, Sani Muhammed, who assured him of the readiness of all staff to work together in ensuring that Ebola does not come in the country. In his remarks the Director Port Health Services, Dr. Hassan Garba said that the sophisticated thermal camera installed, captures all the arriving passengers with or without their knowledge. Anybody showing red on the camera, would be  quietly called side for questioning. The Minister further directed that any passengers with fever arriving from a county where Ebola is been detected should be taken for further investigation. Nigeria began health screening at airports during the Ebola crisis of 2014, and it has continued since then.
