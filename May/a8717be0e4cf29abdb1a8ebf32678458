The trial of the National Commandant of the Peace Corps of Nigeria, Dickson Akoh, was on Tuesday stalled, following his appeal to the Abuja Federal High Court to allow him write his masters examination at the University of Abuja. Akoh, who in a letter to the court attached his examination timetable appealed to the court for an adjournment. The Peace Corps Commandant is currently standing trial on a 90-count charge bordering on extortion. Admitting to receiving Akoh’s letter, counsel to the Federal Government, Aminu Halilu told the court that the reason the Peace Corps Commandant gave was not strong enough since he was not sick. Against this backdrop, Halilu prayed the court to revoke the bail granted Akoh. However, Akoh’s lawyer, Kanu Agabi, said his client would never take the court for granted, stressing that he would make himself available on the next adjourned date. Agabi said even those serving prison terms were always allowed to go for examination. The trial judge, Justice John Tsoho, after listening to both arguments, said Akoh proved a genuine reason why he was absent in court by providing his examination timetable and other documents. He refused to grant Halilu’s request for the revocation of Akoh’s bail. Consequently, Justice Tsoho adjourned the matter till July 5.
