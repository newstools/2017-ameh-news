Osun State Governor, Rauf Aregbesola, on Tuesday stated that the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai, averted coup in Nigeria. Aregbesola made the declaration at the Osun State House of Assembly in Osogbo, the state capital. He urged the House to pass a resolution commending Buratai for his thorough professionalism and belief in the current democracy. The governor also called for a probe into the coup allegation with a view to bringing any erring officer to book. Recall that Buratai, last week, said he received information that some individuals were approaching some officers and soldiers for political reasons. Brigadier General Sani Kukasheka Usman, Director Army Public Relations, said on the basis of that, Buratai “has warned such persons to desist from these acts”. Aregbesola, however, canvassed for a change in the mode of legislative representation based on only geographical space to more modern criteria like occupation and professional categories. His words: “I have also made the strident call for a political system and practice that is best suited for our clime, which will bring inclusion and amount to real political empowerment for all the people. “I have, after our revered leaders, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, Chief Bola Ige, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu and others, all convinced federalist, argued that for a plural society like ours, true federal practice is a minimum condition of statehood. “We are so diverse as a people that anything short of true federalism is an invitation to chaos.” Meanwhile, the presidency has reacted to the media reports on coup plot.
