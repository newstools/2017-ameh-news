The leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, has been granted bail by the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja on Tuesday. Kanu was granted bail on health grounds. The IPOB leader is also expected to provide three sureties one of whom must be a serving Senator, a Jewish religious leader and highly respected person, who own land anywhere in Abuja. The bail bond has been set at N100 million for each surety. Kanu was also ordered never to grant any interviews to the press, pending the outcome of his trial. He will not be seen in a gathering of more than 10 people. Justice Binta Nyako made it clear that Kanu’s bail will be revoked, if any of the orders are flouted. However, the other accused persons were denied bail. According to Justice Nyako, treasonable felony – the charges against them is a serious offence against the state.
