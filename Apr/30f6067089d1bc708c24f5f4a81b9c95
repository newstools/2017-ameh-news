The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, is currently in a closed-door meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Mr. Dogara went into the president’s office at about 11:57 a.m. Sources at the villa also said the President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki will also be meeting with Mr. Buhari after Mr. Dogara. The meetings are coming on the heels of apparent Executive/ Legislative rift following the refusal of the Nigerian Senate to consider and approve the list of 27 Resident Electoral Commissioners, REC. The Senate said it is stepping down the confirmation hearings in protest against the continued retention of Ibrahim Magu as acting chairman of the EFCC by Mr. Buhari in spite of the lawmakers’ refusal to confirm him twice.
