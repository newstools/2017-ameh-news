Nestle Nigeria has restated its commitment to support young people by boosting youth entrepreneurship and inspiring the talented ones through providing training and job opportunities. The company’s Corporate Communications and Public Affairs Manager, Victoria Uwadoka, restated the commitment in a statement on Monday in Lagos, to uphold the organisation’s ideals as it celebrated this year’s International Youth Day on August 12. Uwadoka said that the move was to ensure they gained the skills that would enable them to contribute positively toward building peace in the society. She said, “This is in line with the United Nations (UN) Sustainable development Goal 8, which aims to promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full off productive employment and decent work for all.’’ Nestle Nigeria’s youth empowerment initiatives include a training programme at its Technical Training Centre in the company’s Agbara Factory Complex in Ogun. The programme helps to develop and train young technicians for the world of work. The other is “My Own Business (MYOWBU) Street-Vending Programme’’ which provides young people with the skills and expertise they need to run their own micro-enterprises.
