The Borno Command of the The Nigeria Customs Service has said it generated over N72 million as revenue, in spite of the security challenges posed by the Boko Haram insurgency in the state. The Controller of the service in the state, Mr Joshua Angbalaga, who disclosed this in Maiduguri, said the amount was generated between January and June, exceeding the target of N62 million. Angbalaga explained that the figure was higher than the N25 million generated by the command in 2016 during the same period. He disclosed that the command had also seized 110 bags of rice, 110 jerry cans of cooking oil and hundreds of used tires. He said that the items were impounded by the command when some businessmen imported them into the country. The controller said the command would hand over the used tires to the Standard Organisation of Nigeria (SON). “We recorded significant success in the past six months in spite of the security challenges.” “Initially, we had 13 border posts, regrettably only two are functioning now due to the Boko Haram insurgency,” he said. Angbalaga reiterated the command’s readiness to continue to discharge its duties effectively in spite of the challenges
