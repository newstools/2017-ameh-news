Kaduna State Government on Friday said it would achieve the over N24 billion internal revenue target it set for the 2017 fiscal year. The State Commissioner for Budget and Planning, Muhammad Sani, gave the assurance in an interview with newsmen in Kaduna shortly after the opening of the third quarter retreat on the implementation of the 2017 budget. He explained that N11 billion has so far been generated from internally revenue sources by the government, adding that the N24 billion target would be met by the end of December. Sani said the government generated N23 billion as IGR in 2016, the highest in the history of the state. On the retreat, the commissioner said it was to review budget performance, identify and plug lapses. “There is the need to talk to each other on progress regularly, if we only speak to ourselves once in a year you will find that mistakes that would have been corrected long time ago are not corrected.” He said the quarterly meeting brings together key actors in the running of the administration to find out what they have done in delivering services to the people. “This is the third one for the year; it is to check progress of the government in implementing it’s budget and promises made to the people of the state.” “Every single ministry is called to present what they have done in the last quarter and from the beginning of the year, and jointly agree on the way forward.” “The treat is to catch up on progress made in implementing the budget both in terms of revenue, performance and expenditure,” Sani said.
