As part of an effort to improve digital literacy among children, Sterling Bank Plc says it has opened a summer camp in Lagos to expose kids to coding language during the summer holidays. The fun-filled summer camp, which is being organised in collaboration with Audax Code School, is aimed at improving digital literacy through coding among primary and secondary school students in the country. The camp commenced on Monday and would end on August 18. The Chief Marketing Officer, Sterling Bank, Mr. Henry Bassey, while speaking on the summer camp initiative, said the bank was keen to play a significant role in bridging any gap in the digital skills of Nigerian children and to empower them and their teachers in the science of coding. According to him, coding is the language of the future. In a statement by the lender on Monday, Bassey was quoted as saying, “At Sterling Bank, we are interested in activities that will foster creativity and critical thinking. We have ensured that learning at the summer camp will take place in a fun and collaborative environment so as to encourage many of them to take up careers in Information and Communications Technology. “The children will also be exposed to aspects of our Sterling Environmental Makeover programme which seeks to promote environmental sustainability, good sanitation and hygiene, among others.” He listed some of the modules to be covered at the camp as: introduction to programming with python, web application development with python, beginner web development, basic computer fundamentals and digital marketing/social media.
