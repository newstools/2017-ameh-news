According to the statement “the first half of 2017 has witnessed the country’s production levels steadily recovering to normalcy. This has largely been as a result of the containment of the Niger Delta unrest, and the more recent resumption of activity on the Trans Forcados Pipeline, it was noted.  There is optimism around the approval of the Petroleum Industry Governance and Institutional Framework Bill (PIGB), which should result in a more efficiently regulated sector and a conducive business environment for industry players.”  Commenting on the sterling results, Wale Tinubu, Group Chief Executive, Oando PLC said: “With security concerns in the Niger Delta receding, Nigeria’s economic recovery has been buoyed by a boost in oil output, while the legislative approval of certain segments of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) provides greater long-term policy certainty for the sector.

Within the prevalent crude pricing regime, we remain committed to optimizing our overall production base, seeking unique profit-driven opportunities to further partner with IOCs, while firming up our balance sheet to provide greater shareholder value.”  Operational Update Oando Energy Resources (OER) recorded an average production of 39,950 boe/day compared to 44,892 boe/day in the first half of 2016.
