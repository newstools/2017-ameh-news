The external reserves had gone down as low as $24bn last year. For some months, the country’s dollar reserves were hovering around $30bn. Meanwhile, The CBN is planning to sell N62.43bn ($171m) of treasury bills at an auction next Wednesday. The bank is planning to offer N32.43bn in three-month paper and N30bn of a six-month bill.

The central bank issues treasury bills twice a month to help the government to finance its budget deficit, curb money supply growth and provide an avenue for lenders to manage liquidity.
