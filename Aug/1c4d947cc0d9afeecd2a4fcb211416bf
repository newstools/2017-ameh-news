Mr. Salisu Fagge, Assistant Inspector-General of Police in charge of Zone 8 Abuja, on Wednesday assured residents of the zone of adequate security during and after the forthcoming Eid-el-Kabir celebrations. Fagge gave the assurance in a telephone interview with the News Agency of Nigeria in Minna. He said the three commissioners of police in FCT, Niger and Kaduna states had been issued with operational order to provide effective security during and after the period. He explained that the zone would also increase its patrol teams on Abuja-Kaduna federal highway to ensure the safety of road users. He assured motorists that security measures put in place would deal with any form of threats. He called on residents to volunteer information about bad elements in their midst. He added that adequate security personnel would be stationed at strategic locations such as prayer grounds, children parks, recreational centres and other suspected crime spots. He, therefore, advised residents of Niger, Kaduna, and FCT Abuja to cooperate with all security personnel for peaceful celebrations. Fagge urged members of the public, especially those traveling, to be vigilant and report any suspicious movement to the nearest security formation within their localities.
