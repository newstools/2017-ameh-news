The Consumer Protection Council, says it has neither contributed nor participated in the dispute or judicial process against Coca-cola. A statement signed by the  Consumer Protection Council’s Deputy Director,Public relations,Abiodun Obimuyiwa, said the only connection with the case was the role played by the director General before his appointment. “Our attention has been drawn to a publication suggesting that the CPC secured judgment in the sum of 17 Million Naira against Coca Cola from the Supreme Court of Nigeria Although the story factually reports that the current Director General of the CPC prior to his appointment as Director General was a partner at SimmonsCooper Partners, and in that role, represented the Respondent in that Appeal (Mrs Titilayo Akisanya) in this case which emanated from the National Industrial Court as far back as 2012. The subject of the litigation appears to be a private employment dispute between Coca Cola and Akisanya. The conflict was not about, or on account of a consumer issue or failure. There was no underlying complaint or apparent statutory jurisdiction of the CPC. Essentially, the only child connection of the CPC to this case is that the court decision was delivered by the Supreme Court at a time after counsel of record, Babatunde Irukera was appointed by the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as Director General of the CPC, even though he previously argued the case before this appointment. CPC stated that Coca Cola, like any other company is within the consumer protection jurisdiction of the CPC, “this case was not about any such issue and the CPC neither contributed nor participated in the dispute or judicial process”.
