Today is another Federal Executive Council meeting. Normally, the President chairs the meeting, but since President Muhammadu Buhari returned from his 104-day medical vacation on August 19, 2017, he has had one reason or the other to not hold the meeting. This has made Nigerians wonder if the President still needs more rest. In the interim, Nigerians are watching, to see if Mr. President will preside over the meeting today, or call it off again, as the Vice President is not expected to head the meeting while the President is present in the country.
