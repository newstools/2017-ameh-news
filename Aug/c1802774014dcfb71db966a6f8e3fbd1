Dizengoff Nigeria has announced the delivery of 50 units of 75HP CASE IH tractors to tractor service providers. It said that the first set of tractors was being delivered immediately while the second batch would be delivered by end of August. The delivery, according to the firm, is aimed at providing the much-needed farm mechanisation services for Nigerian farmers. A statement quoted the Chief Executive Officer/Country Manager for Dizengoff Nigeria, Mr. Antti Ritvonen, as saying that the firm was committed to supporting its customers’ operations. He said, “We assure you of our best in class after sales support, to minimise any downtime. We are determined and committed to providing quality machinery services to all of our tractor owners in Nigeria. “We have an exclusive partnership agreement with CASE IH in the delivery of tractors in Nigeria, and the partnership includes technical support in the areas of training, after-sales service support and constant supply of genuine spare parts. We are committed to providing the best possible solution at a most affordable price to all the Nigerian farmers.” “This tractor initiative with tractor service provider will help increase the income of our farmers, reduce production costs and help create opportunities for farmers in the country. One of the issues limiting the increase of food production in the country is poor level of mechanisation.”
