 A position on the political future of the Ikwerre ethnic nationality will be taken in January, 2018. This is meant to mark the beginning of the political squabble between the two main political parties in Rivers state, the People’s Democratic Party and the All Progressives Congress ahead of the 2019 general elections. Recall that the two major political heavyweights in Rivers state, Governor Nyesom Wike and Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi are both both from the Ikwerre extraction. Speaking with newsmen President General of a socio-political group, Ikwerre Youth Movement, Azubuike Wanjoku said Ikwerre people will take a definite position on the unending rift between Wike and Amaechi. Wanjoku said Ikwerre people have been given a bad name by Governor Wike adding that the notion about Ikwerre people lacking leadership prowess must be corrected. According to him, “On the 13th of January, Ikwerre people will make a statement. A statement that will herald 2019. “We have heard people say Ikwerre people said this and that about Wike. No, you have not heard anything. Ikwerre people will speak in one loud voice in January. “For more than 35 years Ikwerre people were denied power in Rivers state before an Ikwerre man, Amaechi took over and removed us from the dust. “After few years another Ikwerre takes over and you can see for yourself. This is not how Ikwerre people behave.
