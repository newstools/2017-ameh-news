The Egina field was discovered by Total Upstream Nigeria Limited (TUPNI) in 2003 within the Oil Mining Licence 130 (OML130), some 200 kilometres south of Port Harcourt, Nigeria. The field is being developed by Total Upstream Nigeria Ltd in partnership with NNPC, CNOOC, SAPETRO and PETROBRAS. It will add 200,000 barrels per day to Nigeria’s oil production (approximately 10% of the country’s total oil production).  Egina is the largest investment project currently on-going in the oil and gas sector in Nigeria. The overall progress of the project stands at 88% and a key milestone was achieved on October 31st, 2017 as the Floating, Production, Storage and Offloading unit (FPSO) started its journey to Nigeria. The project is expected to be completed in Q4 – 2018, within the initial budget of 16 Billion USD.  Being the first major deepwater development project launched after the enactment of the Nigerian Oil & Gas Industry Content Development (NOGICD) Act of 2010, Egina has the highest level of local content of any such project in Nigeria.
