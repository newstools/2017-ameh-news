 Nigeria Army serving under the Operation Lafiya Dole in Borno State have killed 20 Boko Haram members and recovered some deadly weapons. Weapons purportedly recovered from the terrorists include 3 Toyota Land Cruiser Gun Trucks, 5 AK-47 Riffles, 3 Fabrique Nationals (FN) Riffles, 2 G3 Riffles and 1 Pump Action Rifle.  Other items were 1 Rocket Propelled Grenade (RPG) tube, 2 Bombs, 2 Very High Frequency (VHF) Radios and 1 Night Vision Google. The Deputy Director Public Relations, Colonel Timothy Antigha, on Wednesday in a statement said the soldiers were able to arrest 17 of the sect members while rescuing over 100 people. Antigha said the operation was made possible following a supported air bombardment by the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) “In continuation of Operation DEEP PUNCH 2, designed to smoke out Boko Haram terrorists inhabiting remote islands in Lake Chad basin lying within the Nigerian territory, troops of 8 Division, Nigerian Army, on Operation LAFIYA DOLE, supported by soldiers of the Armed Forces Strike Group have inflicted heavy casualty on the Boko Haram terrorists. “The operation which commenced about two weeks ago was proceeded by coordinated air and artillery bombardment of islands and localities occupied by terrorists, and from where they sneak into Magumeri, Kauram and other locations to loot property and attack security personnel and villagers. “So far, 20 terrorists have been killed, captured 17 others, while over 100 elderly men, women and children have been rescued. Preliminary investigation has revealed that a large number of the rescued persons were held against their will and forced to work on farms under life-threatening conditions and penurious wages. More investigation and interviews will be conducted before the rescued persons are handed over for further action,” the statement reads. The army spokesman, however, said that six soldiers sustained various injuries and have since been evacuated for prompt medical attention.
